## Summary

I am a scientist with degrees in engineering and computer science - with a passion for optimizing existing products and processes through digitalization or designing new ones by innovation. For this purpose, I identify current weaknesses and capture people's needs. I like to ask if and how the established can be rethought. When it comes to the conceptual design, I get inspiration by other domains, as similar problems may have already been solved elsewhere.

To elaborate designs and solution strategies, I make use of my learning mindset. Data and extracting knowledge from them through algorithms have also become part of my craft, but I have learned to question whether the desired information is available at all. The philosophical aspects of my work are close to my heart because today's solutions can become tomorrow's problems. I firmly believe that with creativity, collaboration, and communication, great things can be created. Once the goal is set, I push to make sure it is achieved.

In previous activities, for instance, I have:

* helped pharmaceutical companies become more efficient at evaluating process steps by developing decision-support tools based on experimental data and numerical simulations,
* assisted physicians predict mortality and assess existing therapies by machine learning applied to clinical data,
* or enabled authorities perform reliable measurements through the automation and data-driven design of maintenance operations.
