## Summary

I'm a scientist with degrees in engineering and computer science - with a passion for optimizing existing products and processes through digitalization or designing new ones by innovation. For this purpose, I identify current weaknesses and capture people's needs. I like to ask if and how the established can be rethought. When it comes to generating ideas, I get inspiration by other domains, as similar problems may have already been solved elsewhere.

My continuous learning mindset comes in handy when elaborating designs and solution strategies. Data and extracting knowledge from them through algorithms have also become part of my craft, but I have learned to question whether the desired information is available at all. The philosophical aspects of my work are close to my heart because today's solutions can become tomorrow's problems. I firmly believe that with creativity, collaboration, and communication, great things can be created. Once the goal is set, I push to make sure it is achieved.

In previous activities, for instance, I have:

* helped pharmaceutical companies become more efficient at evaluating process steps by developing decision-support tools based on experimental data and numerical simulations,
* assisted physicians predict mortality and assess existing therapies by machine learning applied to clinical data,
* or enabled authorities perform reliable measurements through the automation and data-driven design of maintenance operations.
