## Who am I?

I am a scientist–engineer with a dual foundation in **chemical engineering** and **computer science**, shaped by a long-standing drive to question assumptions and redesign how things work. My professional center of gravity lies in **digital transformation** for **life sciences**, where I combine data science, process systems thinking, and user-driven design to build solutions that are both technically robust and operationally meaningful.
What differentiates me is a **concept-builder mentality**: I enjoy synthesizing insights across disciplines, exposing constraints early, and architecting systems that scale rather than merely optimizing what already exists. I am deeply analytical, yet equally reflective—constantly examining whether data-driven approaches truly generate insight or simply add noise, and how technology choices shape long-term capability rather than short-term output.
Colleagues describe me as curious, creative, and intellectually rigorous. I thrive in environments that value depth of thought, cross-functional collaboration, and the courage to rethink established workflows. My energy comes from turning ambiguity into clarity, and transforming promising ideas into practical, well-structured solutions.
Outside of work, I pursue travel, photography, writing, and sports—activities that mirror my inclination to explore, observe, and understand the world from multiple angles.
