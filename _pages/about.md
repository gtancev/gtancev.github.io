## Who am I?

I am a scientist and engineer with a unique dual background in **chemical engineering** and **computer science**, driven by a passion for challenging conventional thinking and reimagining established processes. With a strong foundation in **digital innovation**, I focus on uncovering user needs, addressing technological constraints, and drawing cross-disciplinary insights to inform impactful solutions.

My work sits at the intersection of data science, process systems, and product development, where I balance rigorous analytical thinking with philosophical reflection on the broader consequences of innovation. I bring a critical perspective on data-driven methodologies, always questioning whether meaningful insights are attainable and how they translate into real-world impact.

Known for my curiosity, creativity, and collaborative mindset, I thrive in environments that value continuous learning and thoughtful experimentation. I am committed to turning visionary ideas into reality through clear communication and disciplined execution.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy travel, photography, writing, reading, and sports--activities that reflect my inquisitive nature and love for exploration.
