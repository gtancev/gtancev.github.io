## Summary

Our exhaled breath is made up of many organic molecules that can be analyzed by secondary electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (SESI-MS). The concentration of these molecules in the breath is proportional to their concentration in the blood and therefore reflects metabolism. This can be used, for example, to detect degradation products of drugs, which enables research into pharmacokinetics. I worked on this topic as part of Pablo Sinues' group at the University Children's Hospital in Basel. The aim was to standardize the method. [I carried out experiments and analyzed the metabolomics data using MATLAB](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-019-01764-8). As the lab was new, I was also responsible for organizing relevant materials.
