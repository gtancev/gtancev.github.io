## Summary

openPK (Fig. 1) is an interactive website I developed to simulate **pharmacokinetic concentration–time profiles**. Users can adjust parameters such as **dose**, **body weight**, and others, and immediately observe how drug concentrations evolve within the body.

The project started with a simple real-world question — whether 500 mg of paracetamol is “too much.” To answer this reliably, I implemented a **multi-compartment PK model** from the scientific literature and combined it with reference values for therapeutic and toxic concentration ranges. From this initial use case, the project evolved into a general tool for PK exploration.

openPK demonstrates how scientific models can be translated into **accessible, web-based applications** that:
- make pharmacokinetic principles intuitive,
- illustrate how individual parameters affect exposure,
- and highlight fundamental concepts of **personalized medicine**, where patient-specific characteristics lead to different concentration–time outcomes.

The project showcases how digital simulations can support **more individualized therapeutic understanding**, making drug behaviour more transparent for both lay users and healthcare professionals.
