## Summary

The effect of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the human body is individual. Pharamcokinetic models and simulations can be used to determine when additional doses must be administered or when the lethal doses are reached. After a discussion with a friend - she was afraid of 500 mg of paracetamol - I decided to address her concerns. I implemented a multi-compartment model from the academic literature and made a website that I could use to show her what the effect was on her organism. With lethal reference values from the literature, I was able to show her that she had nothing to fear. That was the birth of [openPK](https://openpk.herokuapp.com/home).
