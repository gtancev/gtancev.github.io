## Summary

High levels of air pollution are harmful to health. Measurement devices are often expensive and therefore sparsely distributed spatially. In some parts of the world, access is even lacking. Furthermore, research has shown that air pollution can vary heavily in small scales, so the personal exposure is often not known. The hope is that such gaps can be filled using low-cost gas sensor systems and networks. However, their reliability is low. The goal of this project was to identify failure modes and design protocols so that trustworthiness can be increased or monitored. The work in this project was the basis for my doctoral degree.
