## Summary

In drug development, the appropriate processes for manufacturing must be designed. This involves many decisions, which are often only made through experiments. However, these are time-consuming and costly. In order to make this process more efficient, simulations can be used, for example. The parameters of the chemical system under consideration serve as input. Afterwards, it can be decided which route is more suitable (Fig. 1).

I worked on such issues during my internship at Novartis. I implemented simulations and defined metrics that can be used to make decisions.
