## Description

I worked on this project as part of [Julia Vogt's research group](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/team/detail/julia-vogt/) together with clinical scientists at the University Children's Hospital Basel.
Various parameters must be considered for dialysis intensity dosing in pediatric patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. What has been observed is that certain children die relatively quickly after starting treatment. Armed with a huge data set of demographic, treatment, and laboratory data, my task was to look for all possible [risk factors and biomarkers](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/36/3/519/5854486).

The analysis showed that some variables are indeed more relevant than others. Some are merely biomarkers and were already known from the literature, other were new and required careful discussion. Interestingly, one of the main results was that the therapy was already quite optimal in terms of dosage.
