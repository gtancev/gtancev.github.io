## Summary


In the final step in the production of biologics (i.e., large molecules), the drug substance, excipients and water must be mixed and filled into the appropriate containers (e.g., vials or syringes). Although the actual production processes are automated, many other processes such as planning and troubleshooting are manual and time-consuming.

In particular, a variety of data is generated that can be used to support decision making. This includes data from electronic batch records, sensor and alarm data from the operational historian, or business data from the enterprise resource system. The aim of this work was to scrutinise and digitalise the manual processes and tap into the available data in order to implement data-driven operations.
